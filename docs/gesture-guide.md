## 🎯 Pro Tips

### For Best Recognition
- **Good Lighting**: Ensure your hands are well-lit
- **Contrasting Background**: Avoid busy backgrounds behind your hands  
- **Steady Hands**: Hold gestures for 0.5-1 seconds
- **Distance**: Keep hands 2-3 feet from camera
- **Hand Size**: Fill about 1/4 of the camera frame

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ Moving hands too quickly
- ❌ Partial gestures (fingers not fully extended)
- ❌ Too close to camera
- ❌ Poor lighting/shadows
- ❌ Using both hands simultaneously

### Gesture Flow Example
1. **Left hand: 2 fingers** → Selects card 2
2. **Right hand: pinch** → Grabs card for positioning  
3. **Move pinched hand** → Positions card on battlefield
4. **Right hand: open palm** → Deploys the card
5. **Left hand: thumbs up** → "Thanks" emote

## 🔧 Calibration Tips

If gestures aren't working well:

1. **Check the camera feed** - you should see hand landmarks drawn
2. **Adjust lighting** - avoid shadows on your hands
3. **Practice gestures** - make them clear and distinct
4. **Try different distances** - find your sweet spot

## 🎮 Game-Specific Notes

- **Card selection** happens instantly when gesture is recognized
- **Drag and deploy** requires smooth hand movement
- **Emotes** have a small delay to prevent accidental triggers
- **Screen coordinates** are mapped to your game window position
