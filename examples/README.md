# Examples Folder

This folder is for demo files and examples of the gesture control system in action.

## What Goes Here:
- Demo videos (`mp4`, `mov`)  
- Screenshots of the system working
- Example gesture recordings
- Tutorial materials

## Note:
Large demo files are excluded from git to keep the repository lightweight. 
You can add your own demo files locally for testing and demonstration.
